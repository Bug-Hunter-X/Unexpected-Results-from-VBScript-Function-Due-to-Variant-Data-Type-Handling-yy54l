This repository contains a VBScript function that exhibits unexpected behavior due to the implicit type coercion of variant data types. The `bug.vbs` file demonstrates the issue where the function produces incorrect results because of unintended type conversions. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version of the function that explicitly handles data types, ensuring accurate calculations and expected results.
